List of relevant files: Server.c Client.c README.txt File.txt

Instructions: In the terminal, run "gcc -o Client Client.c" and "gcc -o Server Server.c", you will get two files called "Client" and "Server". Then run "Server" first with the command "./Server". In addition, open another terminal and run "Client" using the command "./Client 127.0.0.1"(Note: You have to enter the ip address 127.0.0.1 to build the connection with the server). Then you can input the file name which is "File.txt" in the directory.

In my folder, I have already generated the "Server" file and the "Client" file. So you can just run the files by type the command "./Server" and "./Client 127.0.0.1".(Note: Remember to open a new terminal when run the "Client" file.)
