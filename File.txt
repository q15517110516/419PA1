In this assignment, you will write a program over TCP to allow a client to download files from a server. The
detailed process is as follows.
1. The server starts and waits for incoming connection request.
2. The client establishes a TCP connection with the server.
3. The client sends a filename to the server over the TCP connection.
4. The server receives the filename.
5. If the file is not present, the server informs the client by sending back an error message.
6. If the file is present, the server continuously reads the file into a buffer and sends the buffer content to the
client until file-end is reached. File end is marked by EOF.
7. Once the transmission finishes, the client verifies that the received file is correct. You need decide the
mechanism that enables verification at the client.
8. The client chooses to download a different file or close the TCP connection and exit.
The user interface need not be sophisticated, but should be usable. It can be text-based or graphical. Your program
should use TCP sockets.
